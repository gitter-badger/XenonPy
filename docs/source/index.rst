XenonPy's
=================================

**XenonPy** is a Python library which be designed for material development based on machine learning.

This project focus on material informatics.
The final goal of this project is to build a all-in-one material development environment include:

* **Datasets out-of-box**
* **Effective descriptor calculation methods**
* **Model training and store**
* **Pre-trained model collection**
* **Combined with deep learning**

XenonPy build on `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`_ and `PyTorch <http://pytorch.org/>`_ in order to make various downstream machine learning libraries.

XenonPy is `open source <https://github.com/yoshida-lab/XenonPy>`_.
